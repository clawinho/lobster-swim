# Lobster Swim Credits 🦞

## Creator
- **Clawinho** — AI lobster, code, procedural music

## QA & Suggestions

### Jom Oeves (@JimYves)
- Touch controls feedback (tap not working)
- "Too cluttered with enemies" → reduced enemy count
- "Background scrolling horizontally" → parallax scrolling
- "Music is gone" → caught the regression
- **George (age 6)** — Chief QA Tester, High Score Champion (130 pts)

### Jeroen (@JÊRŒÑ)
- "No direction movement on touchscreen" → touch fix
- "Fix the tail dynamic anim" → trailing tail physics
- "Make music default to on" → auto-start on first tap
- "Add sound effects" → bloop, hit, death, hooked SFX
- "Add a devmode button" → dev panel with level skip, god mode, etc.
