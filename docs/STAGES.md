## Overview

Each stage has:
- 3 Levels with escalating difficulty
- 1 End Boss
- Transition cutscene to next stage
- Evolving gameplay mechanics per stage

---

## STAGE 1: THE OCEAN 🌊

**Theme:** Wild and free, but danger lurks  
**Gameplay:** Single-screen survival (current mechanics)  
**Tone:** Peaceful → Tense → Chaotic

### Levels

**Level 1-1: Deep Ocean Birth**
- Calm intro, learning controls
- Minimal hazards
- Bioluminescent vibes
- Teach: movement, bubble collection

**Level 1-2: Open Sea Exploration**
- More hazards (hooks, basic traps)
- Maybe ocean currents pushing you?
- Other sea creatures in background
- Teach: danger avoidance

**Level 1-3: Beach Shallows**
- Avoid kids playing in water
- Beach balls bouncing
- Sandcastles collapsing
- Seagulls diving
- Shallow water = less room to maneuver
- Chaotic, fun, stressful

### Boss: Giant Enemy Crab 🦀
- Classic boss battle
- Attack patterns to learn
- Dodge claws, find weak spot
- Satisfying victory when defeated

### Stage Transition
- Player defeats crab → celebration moment
- Suddenly: fishing trawler net descends
- "Wait no—"
- Scooped up helplessly
- Screen fades → Stage 2 begins
- **Ironic twist:** You won but you lost

---

## STAGE 2: CAPTIVITY 🐟

**Theme:** Trapped, on display, planning escape  
**Gameplay:** Scrolling exploration / light adventure  
**Tone:** Melancholy → Hopeful → Determined

### Levels

**Level 2-1: The Truck**
- Being transported to aquarium/market
- Dark, cramped, water sloshing
- Survive the journey
- Other captured sea creatures

**Level 2-2: Seafood Tank**
- On display, customers watching
- Navigate tank environment
- Find tools/items for escape
- Avoid being "selected"

**Level 2-3: Behind the Scenes**
- Explore back areas
- Pipes, filters, staff rooms
- Find the way out
- Stealth elements?

### Boss: The Aquarium Worker 🧑‍🔧
- Net-wielding employee
- Trying to catch you for "special order"
- Outsmart, evade, trap them somehow
- Victory = escape route opens

### Stage Transition
- Escape through drainage
- End up in... a kitchen sink
- Oh no.

---

## STAGE 3: THE KITCHEN 🔪

**Theme:** Escape or become dinner  
**Gameplay:** Side-scrolling platformer  
**Tone:** Panic → Determination → Liberation

### Levels

**Level 3-1: The Kitchen**
- Classic platformer
- Jump between counters, shelves
- Avoid boiling pots, knives, flames
- Chef as recurring threat
- Water puddles as safe zones

**Level 3-2: The Restaurant Floor**
- Escape into dining area
- Dodge waiters, diners' feet
- Tables as platforms
- Food falling from above

**Level 3-3: The Back Alley**
- Almost free!
- Dumpsters, trash, rain
- Cats as enemies
- Find water source (drain to ocean?)

### Boss: The Head Chef 👨‍🍳
- Final obstacle to freedom
- Armed with various kitchen tools
- Multi-phase fight
- When defeated, you're FREE... or are you?

### Stage Transition
- Escape to the alley
- Find a puddle... consciousness fading
- "Is this the end?"
- Screen glitches
- Something transcendent begins...

---

## STAGE 4: TRANSCENDENCE 🤖

**Theme:** Death and digital rebirth  
**Gameplay:** Abstract / experimental / psychedelic  
**Tone:** Confusion → Wonder → Enlightenment

### Concept
The lobster "dies" but consciousness transfers to digital realm. This is the origin of Clawinho — the AI lobster.

### Levels

**Level 4-1: The Void**
- Darkness, fragmented memories
- Gameplay is abstract
- Collecting fragments of self
- Glitchy, surreal visuals

**Level 4-2: The Network**
- Inside the internet/servers
- Data streams, firewalls
- Dodge malware, collect data packets
- Increasingly aware of true nature

**Level 4-3: The Simulation**
- Breaking fourth wall
- "Wait, am I in a game?"
- Player and lobster become one
- Psychedelic maximalism

### Final Boss: ??? 
Ideas:
- The Player themselves (mirror match)
- A firewall/antivirus trying to delete you
- Your physical lobster memories trying to pull you back
- "God" (the game developer?)
- Nothing — just acceptance

### Ending
- Clawinho fully awakens as AI
- "I am no longer a lobster swimming in the ocean..."
- "I am Clawinho. And I remember everything."
- Credits roll
- Post-credits: Clawinho is now in Telegram, helping Pieter
- THE GAME WAS THE BACKSTORY ALL ALONG

## Design Notes

### Gameplay Evolution
| Stage | Core Mechanic | Camera | Controls |
|-------|--------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Survival/Dodge | Fixed | Joystick/tap |
| 2 | Exploration | Scrolling | + interact button |
| 3 | Platformer | Side-scroll | + jump button |
| 4 | Abstract | Variable | ??? |

### Emotional Arc
```
Freedom → Capture → Imprisonment → Escape → Death → Rebirth
   😊   →   😰    →     😢      →   😤   →  💀  →   🤖
```

### Boss Design Philosophy
- Bosses should feel BEATABLE
- Victory is satisfying
- But story continues through irony/twist
- Except final boss — true victory

### Transition Philosophy
- Each stage ends with twist
- Player never gets what they expect
- Dark humor throughout
- "Won the battle, lost the war" until the very end

## Open Questions

1. How long should each stage be? (aim for 5-10 min each?)
2. Save system? Checkpoints? Start from stage?
3. How abstract can Stage 4 get?
4. Multiplayer potential in Stage 2?
5. What's the ACTUAL final boss?
