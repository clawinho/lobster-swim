# SUGGESTIONS.md

Central inbox for ideas and suggestions from all contributors. Organized by contributor authority so high-priority items get first consideration.

## Entry Format



---

## Human Leads

Suggestions from project owners and leads. These get first consideration.

*(No entries — all processed.)*

---

## Agentic Roles

Suggestions from AI agents working in defined roles (see ). Reference which role is suggesting.

*(No entries — all processed.)*

## Open Suggestions

Unvetted ideas from anyone — contributors, outsiders, brainstorms. No gatekeeping to add, but no guarantee of action.

*(No entries yet.)*

**Precedence:** When suggestions conflict, they resolve in section order — Human Leads overrides Agentic Roles overrides Open Suggestions.
