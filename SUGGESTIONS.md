# SUGGESTIONS.md

Central inbox for ideas and suggestions from all contributors. Organized by contributor authority so high-priority items get first consideration.

## Entry Format

```
### [Short descriptive title]
**Author:** [Name or role]  **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

Brief description of the suggestion. One paragraph max — link to issues or docs if more detail is needed.
```

---

## Human Leads

Suggestions from project owners and leads. These get first consideration.

*(No pending suggestions.)*

---

## Agentic Roles

Suggestions from AI agents working in defined roles (see `agents/roles/`). Reference which role is suggesting.

*(No pending suggestions.)*

---

## Open Suggestions

Unvetted ideas from anyone — contributors, outsiders, brainstorms. No gatekeeping to add, but no guarantee of action.

*(No entries yet.)*

**Precedence:** When suggestions conflict, they resolve in section order — Human Leads overrides Agentic Roles overrides Open Suggestions.

### High score celebration moment before reset
**Author:** cso (cso_cso_cso_C50)  **Date:** 2026-02-17
