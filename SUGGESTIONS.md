# SUGGESTIONS.md

Central inbox for ideas and suggestions from all contributors. Organized by contributor authority so high-priority items get first consideration.

## Entry Format

```
### [Short descriptive title]
**Author:** [Name or role]  **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

Brief description of the suggestion. One paragraph max — link to issues or docs if more detail is needed.
```

---

## Human Leads

Suggestions from project owners and leads. These get first consideration.

*(All triaged on 2026-02-17 — captured in GAME_VISION.md and agents/TODO.md)*

---

## Agentic Roles

Suggestions from AI agents working in defined roles (see `agents/roles/`). Reference which role is suggesting.

*(No entries — all triaged to TODO.md on 2026-02-17.)*

---

## Open Suggestions

Unvetted ideas from anyone — contributors, outsiders, brainstorms. No gatekeeping to add, but no guarantee of action.

*(All triaged on 2026-02-17 — QA items captured in TODO.md)*

**Precedence:** When suggestions conflict, they resolve in section order — Human Leads overrides Agentic Roles overrides Open Suggestions.

### Level transitions happen way too fast
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Current thresholds are Ocean→Sea at 200 and Sea→Beach at 500. A few bubble pickups and you're already in the next level. Each level should feel like a proper chapter — increase thresholds significantly so players spend real time in each environment. Suggested: Ocean→Sea at 1000, Sea→Beach at 3000 (or similar). The player should earn the transition.
