# SUGGESTIONS.md

Central inbox for ideas and suggestions from all contributors. Organized by contributor authority so high-priority items get first consideration.

## Human Leads

Suggestions from project owners and leads. These get first consideration.

### Jeroen (@pixelprotest)
- Fix entity assets not being visible in the asset library — newly created entities don't show up
- Asset library uses hardcoded imports (no Vite on VPS) — find a way to make entity discovery dynamic, or add hardcoded import statements for all recent entities so they appear in the asset library
- Combine the lobster 'a' and 'b' renderer versions into a single renderer — visual differences should be controlled via parameters/checkboxes, not separate lettered versions. Avoid lettered version splits going forward to prevent a versioning spiderweb
- Asset library version tabs overflow when there are 6+ versions — rightmost tabs are unclickable. Center the current/active tab so previous versions scroll left and later versions are visible to the right
- Level 1 (Ocean) environment not showing in the asset library — likely a missing hardcoded import (related to the dynamic import issue above)
- Birth level should open with a big bold "BIRTH" title that fades out epically — pair it with a deep Dolby THX / Stanley Kubrick-style synthesized soundscape (procedural Web Audio: low rumbling drone that swells and decays)
- Birth level needs to feel way more intimate/claustrophobic — the lobster egg should be surrounded by peer eggs, tightly packed and rubbing against each other. Camera should be zoomed in much closer so the eggs dominate the screen, not a distant overview
- Birth level core mechanic: rhythmic/synchronic heartbeat tapping to break free from the egg colony, then catch food to grow. The heartbeat sync should feel like the primary interaction
- Transition from Birth to Ocean is too abrupt — needs a hatching cutscene moment where the egg cracks open and the baby lobster emerges/climbs out before the ocean level begins
- Art Director task: use the Birth level's visual quality (deep dark blues, subtle glows, particle specks) as a reference to uplift Ocean level's look. The seaweed and Ocean environment feel toyish compared to Birth's atmospheric mood — aim for more cohesive visual quality across levels
