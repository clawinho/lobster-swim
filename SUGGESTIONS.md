### Restructure Stage 1: Ocean → Sea → Beach
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

The three levels we currently have (Ocean, Tank, Kitchen) were a good start, but we need to think in 4 stages instead of 3 levels. We are currently developing the FIRST stage only. Instead of Ocean/Tank/Kitchen, Stage 1 should be Ocean, Sea, Beach side levels. Ocean level keeps the current design. Sea should show a slither of sky. Beach side should show HALF top of screen sky and waves, bottom half sandy floor and water with stronger currents and lots of children playing.

### Reduce enemies in early levels
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Currently the first level contains WAY too many enemies. Keep it chill for the player. Ramp up enemies in level 2 (of stage 1) and again in level 3 (stage 1).

### Progressive lobster abilities per level
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Make the lobster more distinct for each level of stage 1. Example: baby lobster that can only move left/right on the ocean floor (reference to Asteroids 80s game) in level 1. In level 2 we start swimming. In level 3 we can jump above water and walk on land.

### Reference 80s/90s iconic games in Stage 1
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Think how we can reference 80s and 90s iconic games inside Stage 1 of the game.

### Research: diverse game styles for stages 2-4
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Start researching how to refactor the game to accommodate very DIVERSE different game styles and assets for subsequent stages 2, 3, and 4. Store findings into a research document to keep for later.

### Lobster needs legs
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Hero lobster might need some legs designed at some point.
