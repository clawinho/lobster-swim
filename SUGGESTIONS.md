## Human Leads

Suggestions from project owners and leads. These get first consideration.

### Level transitions happen way too fast
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Current thresholds are Ocean→Sea at 200 and Sea→Beach at 500. A few bubble pickups and you're already in the next level. Each level should feel like a proper chapter — increase thresholds significantly so players spend real time in each environment. Suggested: Ocean→Sea at 1000, Sea→Beach at 3000 (or similar). The player should earn the transition.

### Level 1 (Ocean) should have zero enemies
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

The first level should be completely innocent — no enemies at all. It's the intro level to set the vibe, let the player explore, learn the controls, and enjoy the ocean. Just bubbles, maybe some goldfish, peaceful vibes. Enemies start appearing in Level 2 (Sea).

### Eel movement too erratic
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

The eel is doing a crazy gyrating motion — tone it down. Should be smoother, more of a calm slithering movement. Less spastic, more menacing.

### Beach level needs visual redesign — underwater perspective
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

The beach level camera should still be INSIDE the water looking toward shore. Visual layout: top half of screen is sky, middle has the waterline with crashing waves, bottom half is the sea with yellow sand as the beach floor (underwater). The sand bank should slope up from left to right across the screen. We're seeing the beach from the lobster's POV — still submerged but near the shore. Beach-specific enemies: seagulls (diving down from above the waterline) and beach balls (floating/bouncing at the surface).
