### New Level 0: Birth — lobster egg survival
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Add a new level BEFORE the current Ocean level. Called Birth — you are a lobster egg among thousands of translucent jelly eggs filling the screen. You're the one that needs to hatch and survive. This becomes the new Level 1, and all current levels shift up (Ocean becomes L2, Sea becomes L3, Beach becomes L4). Stage 1 is now 4 levels: Birth → Ocean → Sea → Beach. Need Director to brainstorm gameplay mechanics for this level — what does a lobster egg do? What are the threats? How do you hatch?

### Director: brainstorm Birth level gameplay
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Director task: brainstorm gameplay ideas for the new Birth level where you play as a lobster egg. Think about: What does the screen look like? (thousands of translucent jelly eggs). What are the threats to an egg? (fish eating eggs, currents sweeping eggs away, temperature changes?). How does the player control an egg? (maybe just gentle drifting/pulsing?). What triggers the hatch into baby lobster? Make it feel primal, vulnerable, beautiful. Reference nature documentaries — real lobster eggs are carried under the mother's tail for months. This is the origin story.
