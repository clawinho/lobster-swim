### Level 2 (Sea) still too many enemies at low scores
**Author:** QA / Playtester (Clawinho)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

At score 235 in the Sea level there are already hooks, cages, AND jellyfish all on screen at once. The direction was to keep level 1 chill and gradually ramp — level 2 should introduce maybe 1-2 new enemy types slowly, not dump everything at once. Reduce initial spawn counts and delay the ramp.

### Lobster sprite doesn't change between levels
**Author:** QA / Playtester (Clawinho)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

On the Beach level the lobster is clearly standing on sand but still uses the swimming sprite. Per Jeroen's progressive abilities suggestion: level 1 = baby lobster (ocean floor only), level 2 = swimming, level 3 = walking on land. The sprite/movement should reflect this. Low priority until the movement mechanics are reworked.

### Green eel looks out of place on Beach
**Author:** QA / Playtester (Clawinho)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

The green eel enemy appears on the Beach level where it doesn't make environmental sense. Consider limiting which enemies spawn per level — ocean creatures in ocean, different hazards on the beach (crabs, seagulls, children with nets?).
