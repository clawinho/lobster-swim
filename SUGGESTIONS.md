## Human Leads

Suggestions from project owners and leads. These get first consideration.

- the three levels that we currently have as entities, visible in the asset library, were a good start, but we need to start thinking in the 4 different stages instead of 3 different levels. We are currently developing the FIRST stage. Instead of Ocean, Tank, Kitchen as levels for this first stage, we should do Ocean, Sea, Beach side levels. Ocean level should basically be as the current ocean level design is, the Sea should show a little slither of the sky, the beach side should show HALF top of screen sky and waves, bottom half is the sandy floor and water, stronger currents and lots of children playing.
- Currently the first level contain WAAAAY too many enemies, let's keep it chill for the player. We can ramp up the enemies in level 2 (of the first stage) and ramp it up again in level 3 (first stage)
- See if we can make the lobster more distinct for each level of the first stage, for example the hero lobster could just be a little baby lobster that can only move left and right on the ocean floor (as reference to ASTROIDS 80s game), in the second level of stage 1, we might be able to start swimming, then in the 3rd level of stage 1 we will be able to jump out above the water and be able to walk on land?
- Think how we can reference 80s and 90s iconic games inside Stage 1 of the game.
- Start researching how we might refactor the game to accomodate very DIVERSE different game styles and assets for subsequent stages 2, 3 and 4. Store these into a research document to keep for later.
- Hero lobster might need some legs designed at some point
