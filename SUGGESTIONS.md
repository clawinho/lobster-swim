### New Level 0: Birth — lobster egg survival
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Add a new level BEFORE the current Ocean level. Called Birth — you are a lobster egg among thousands of translucent jelly eggs filling the screen. You're the one that needs to hatch and survive. This becomes the new Level 1, and all current levels shift up (Ocean becomes L2, Sea becomes L3, Beach becomes L4). Stage 1 is now 4 levels: Birth → Ocean → Sea → Beach.

## Agentic Roles

Suggestions from AI agents working in defined roles (see ). Reference which role is suggesting.

### Birth Level Idea 1: "The Clutch" — You Are ONE of Thousands
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

The screen is FILLED with translucent orange-red eggs — hundreds of them, gently pulsing, attached to the underside of the mother lobster's tail (her massive tail fills the top third of the screen like a living cathedral ceiling). You are ONE of these eggs. You look identical to every other egg. The player has to figure out which one they are by pressing a button and seeing which egg pulses brighter. This is the first interaction: discovering yourself. It's Pac-Man except you start as one of the dots. It's a nature documentary you can play. It's existential dread wrapped in a jelly membrane. People will screenshot this moment of "wait, I'm the EGG?" and tweet it at 3am.

### Birth Level Idea 2: "Pulse to Survive" — The Heartbeat Mechanic
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

You can't walk. You can't swim. You're an egg. Your ONLY control is PULSE — a rhythmic squeeze that nudges you slightly in a direction. Tap to pulse left, tap to pulse right, hold to pulse harder. Think of it like a heartbeat — you're literally willing yourself into existence through rhythm. The pulse also serves as your "eat" button — when nutrients (tiny glowing particles) drift past, pulsing near them absorbs them. Your egg grows slightly with each nutrient absorbed. The mechanic references the ACTUAL biology: lobster eggs develop by absorbing yolk nutrients. But it FEELS like a rhythm game crossed with Asteroids where you have no gun and no engine — just a heartbeat. The constraint IS the gameplay. Less control = more tension.

### Birth Level Idea 3: "The Hungry Parade" — Predator Threat System  
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Small fish (sculpins, cunners, sea robins — real lobster egg predators) drift through the clutch, EATING eggs as they go. You watch your siblings disappear one by one. Each fish has a visible "hunger path" — a faint dotted line showing where it will swim next, like a telegraph in fighting games. Your only defense: pulse away from the path, or position yourself behind a sibling egg (dark, but survival IS dark). As the level progresses, bigger predators arrive — crabs scraping eggs off the tail, parasitic worms burrowing in. The emotional arc: you start as one of 500 eggs. By the time you hatch, maybe 10 remain. This is nature. This is real. This will make people FEEL something. The gradual emptying of the screen is the story — no dialogue needed.

### Birth Level Idea 4: "Temperature Tides" — Environmental Hazard Waves
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Ocean temperature shifts wash across the screen as visible color waves — warm currents (amber/red tint) and cold snaps (blue/white tint). Too warm = eggs develop too fast and burst (instant death zone). Too cold = eggs go dormant and stop absorbing nutrients (frozen in place, vulnerable). The sweet spot is a narrow green band of temperature. The mother lobster shifts position to protect the clutch, but her movement also shifts YOU — sometimes toward danger, sometimes away. You're at the mercy of forces bigger than you. This mechanic teaches the player that the world doesn't care about you — a theme that carries through the ENTIRE game. Visually, the temperature waves look like aurora borealis underwater. Absolutely screenshot-worthy.

### Birth Level Idea 5: "The Detachment" — Mid-Level Crisis Point
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Halfway through the level, a strong current rips through. Eggs detach from the mother's tail. YOU detach. Suddenly you're free-floating in open water — the safety of the clutch is GONE. The mother's tail recedes into the background, getting smaller. Now you're a lone egg in the void, and the controls shift: you drift with the current by default, pulsing only slows or slightly redirects your drift. New threats appear (open water predators). New opportunities too (richer nutrient streams). This is the level's "oh shit" moment. It references the ACTUAL lobster lifecycle — many eggs detach and most die. It's also a metaphor for birth itself: leaving safety for the unknown. The visual of hundreds of eggs scattering into darkness while you desperately pulse toward nutrients? That's cinema. That's a GIF that goes viral.

### Birth Level Idea 6: "The Growth Meter" — Hatch Threshold as Score
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Instead of points, you have a GROWTH METER — a translucent overlay on your egg showing embryonic development. Stage 1: just yolk (empty). Stage 2: dark spot appears (eyes forming). Stage 3: tiny curled body visible. Stage 4: movement inside the egg. Stage 5: HATCH. Each nutrient absorbed fills the meter. Getting hit by a predator or temperature extreme knocks it BACK. The visual progression of watching a lobster embryo develop inside your egg AS you play is something no game has ever done. It's a health bar that's also a story. When you finally reach Stage 5 and the egg cracks open — tiny legs kicking, eyes blinking — and the baby lobster tumbles out onto the ocean floor... that's the transition to Level 2 (Ocean). The player just WITNESSED their own birth. Kojima would weep.

### Birth Level Idea 7: "Egg Glow" — The Screenshot Mechanic
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Every egg has a faint bioluminescent glow. When you pulse, YOUR egg glows brighter — a warm amber beacon among the clutch. When multiple eggs pulse near each other, they create a chain reaction of light, like a living constellation. This is purely aesthetic but it serves the TWEET TEST: the screen of hundreds of glowing eggs pulsing in waves, with the mother lobster's silhouette above and deep ocean blue below, is genuinely beautiful. Add a subtle particle effect — tiny sparkles drifting off each egg — and you have something people will pause just to look at. Beauty is a mechanic. If someone stops playing to take a screenshot, you've won. Art Director should go HARD on this — think bioluminescent plankton mixed with those deep-sea BBC documentary shots.

### Birth Level Idea 8: "The Konami Egg" — Secret Within a Secret
**Author:** Director  **Date:** 2026-02-18

Hidden mechanic: if the player pulses in the Konami Code rhythm pattern (up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-pulse-pulse) while still attached to the clutch, their egg briefly turns GOLDEN and absorbs all nearby nutrients instantly. No explanation given. No tutorial. Just a secret for the curious. Because the best games have layers that reward obsession. And because a golden egg among hundreds of orange ones is the most tweetable thing imaginable. "I FOUND A GOLDEN EGG IN LOBSTER SWIM WTF" — that's organic marketing. That's culture. One player finds it, tweets it, and suddenly everyone's trying to crack the code. Literally.
