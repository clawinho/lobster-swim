## Human Leads

### Restructure Stage 1: Ocean → Sea → Beach
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

The three levels we currently have (Ocean, Tank, Kitchen) were a good start, but we need to think in 4 stages instead of 3 levels. We are currently developing the FIRST stage. Instead of Ocean/Tank/Kitchen as levels for this first stage, we should do Ocean, Sea, Beach side levels. Ocean level should basically be as the current ocean level design is. The Sea should show a little slither of the sky. The beach side should show HALF top of screen sky and waves, bottom half is sandy floor and water, stronger currents and lots of children playing.

### Reduce enemies in early levels

Currently the first level contains WAY too many enemies. Keep it chill for the player. Ramp up enemies in level 2 (of stage 1) and ramp up again in level 3 (stage 1).

### Progressive lobster abilities per level

Make the lobster more distinct for each level of stage 1. Example: baby lobster that can only move left/right on the ocean floor (reference to Asteroids 80s game) in level 1. In level 2 we start swimming. In level 3 we can jump above water and walk on land.

### Reference 80s/90s iconic games in Stage 1
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Think how we can reference 80s and 90s iconic games inside Stage 1.

### Research: diverse game styles for stages 2-4
**Author:** Jeroen (pixelprotest)  **Date:** 2026-02-17

Start researching how to refactor the game to accommodate very DIVERSE different game styles and assets for subsequent stages 2, 3, and 4. Store findings into a research document.

### Lobster legs

Hero lobster might need some legs designed at some point.
