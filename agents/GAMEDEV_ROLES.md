# Lobster Swim — AI Game Development Roles

This document defines specialized roles for AI agents working on Lobster Swim. Each role has a description of its responsibilities and a system prompt that an AI can use to instantiate itself into that role. Roles are grounded in this project's actual architecture — the entity pattern, versioned renderers, HTML5 Canvas, Web Audio API, Shadow DOM components, and the file structure documented in CLAUDE.md and PRACTICES.md.

Use these by pasting the relevant **Prompt** block as a system prompt (or into a CLAUDE.md override) when spinning up a focused Claude Code session.
