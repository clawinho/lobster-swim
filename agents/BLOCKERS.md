## How to log a blocker

Use this format so entries stay consistent across roles:

\`\`\`
- [ ] **[Role Name]** Short description of what's blocked → _Waiting on: <what needs to happen / who needs to act>_
\`\`\`

When the blocker is resolved, remove it (don't check the box — just delete the line).
