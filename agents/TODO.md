## Phase 1: Stage 1 Restructure (Ship by Feb 28)

Priority order — top item is next up.

### Level 1 Bubble Reduction + Falling Pickups (HIGH PRIORITY — Jeroen directive)
- [x] Reduce bubble spawns significantly in Level 1 — each one should feel like a reward, not a carpet
- [x] Add falling pickups that drop from top of screen and land on ocean floor
- [ ] CLAWS pickup — visual upgrade + defensive ability
- [ ] SWIM pickup — collecting this transitions player to Level 2

### Level 2 Grace Period (HIGH PRIORITY — Jeroen directive)
- [x] No enemies at start of Level 2 (Sea) — player just learned to swim
- [x] Grace period before any enemies appear (5 seconds)
- [x] Gradual enemy introduction after grace period ends (spawnOnEnter deferred)

### Beach Boss Encounter
- [ ] Final boss encounter happens ON the beach — no water, fully on land

### Lobster POV (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Lobster POV: still submerged but near shore in Beach level

### Audio (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Music refinement — layered intensity per level (Ocean calm → Sea tension → Beach urgency)

### 80s/90s Game References (LOW PRIORITY — Jeroen directive)
- [ ] Research and plan 80s/90s iconic game references for Stage 1 levels
- [ ] Level 1 Asteroids feel, Level 3 platformer feel
